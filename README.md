Contents:
Data Import and Setup: The Jupyter notebook NoSQL_setup_starter.ipynb contains code to import data from establishments.json into MongoDB, set up the database, and prepare it for analysis.

Database Update: Further modifications to the database are made in the same notebook, including inserting new data, updating existing documents, and removing irrelevant entries.

Exploratory Analysis: The notebook NoSQL_analysis_starter.ipynb conducts exploratory analysis by querying the database to answer specific questions posed by the food magazine.

Key Features:
- Properly imported data into MongoDB, ensuring database integrity.
- Conducted data updates and cleaning operations as per project requirements.
- Performed detailed analysis, answering specific questions regarding hygiene scores,  ratings, and establishment locations.
- Utilized PyMongo and Pandas for data manipulation and visualization.
- Ensured code readability and reproducibility through comprehensive commenting.
